# Apache Storm docker images

These images are part of the bigdata [docker image series](https://github.com/flokkr). All of the images use the same [base docker image](https://github.com/elek/docker-bigdata-base) which contains advanced configuration loading. 

It supports configuration based on environment variables (using specific naming convention), downloaded from consul and other plugins (for example to generate kerberos keystabs).

For more detailed instruction to configure the images see the [README](https://github.com/flokkr/docker-base/blob/master/README.md) in the flokkr/docker-base repository.

## Run

The easiest way to run a storm cluster is just use the included ```docker-compose.yaml``` file. Checkout the repository and do a ```docker-compose up -d``` The storm UI will be available at http://localhost:8080

For more detailed examples check the other repositories under the flokkr organization with [runtime-](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aflokkr+runtime) prefix.
